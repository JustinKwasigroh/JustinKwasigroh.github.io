  <H1>What to do With the Situation Brewing in Baltimore</H1>
  <p> <UL> <LI>Joe Flacco has been the starting Quarterback for the Baltimore Ravens since 2008. 
    <LI>In 2012, he won the Super Bowl, along with the Super Bowl MVP award.
      <IMG src= "FlaccoSuperBowlMVP.jpg" alt= "Flacco hoisting the Super Bowl MVP award">
    <LI>The Ravens have missed the playoffs each of the last 4 seasons, which is why general manager, Ozzie Newsome elected to draft Lamar Jackson in the first round of the 2018 draft.
          <A href= "http://www.espn.com/blog/baltimore-ravens/post/_/id/40012/joe-flaccos-fall-from-super-bowl-mvp-to-31st-ranked-passer-hits-national-stage">             Flacco isn't the player he once was </a>
      <IMG src= "LamarJacksonDraft.jpg" alt= "Flacco's job security isn't what it once was 6 years ago when he won the Super Bowl">
    <LI>This is Newsome's last year as the general manager and many believe this to be a "legacy pick".
      <IMG src= "FlaccoSad.jpg" alt= "An unhappy Flacco after Ravens draft new QB of the future">
    <LI>Now in week 11 of the NFL season, Lamar Jackson got his first career NFL start with Flacco sidelined with an injured hip
      <IMG src= "LamarJacksonStarting.jpg" alt= "">
    <LI>Lamar went on to lead the Ravens to a victory over the Bengals, which brings up the question of when Lamar Jackson will fully take the reigns of the offense from Joe Flacco? </UL>
            <H2>What's the next move?</H2>
            <p>
                Now that Lamar Jackson proved he can come in and win games, what does the coaching staff do when Joe Flacco returns from injury?
                   <UL> <LI>In my opinion the Baltimore Ravens should ride the hot hand and stick with Lamar Jackson at quarterback until he gives them a reason to not play him.
                         <LI>Lamar gives the Ravens an offense that defenses will struggle to prepare for
                               <LI> Jackson also is faster than just about every player on the field, so in most cases he will gain at least a couple yards every play. Also, Flacco doesn't bring the excitement to the field that Jackson does.
                                     <LI>Since Flacco's Super Bowl victory, it has been very apparent that Flacco has checked out mentally and just doesn't care as much as he once did. He got a ring, he got paid, so he's satisfied with his career already. </UL>
