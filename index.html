  <h1>The End of an Era</h1>
  <p> <UL> <LI>Joe Flacco has been the starting Quarterback for the Baltimore Ravens since 2008. 
    <LI>In 2012, he won the Super Bowl, along with the Super Bowl MVP award. 
    <LI>The Ravens have missed the playoffs each of the last 4 seasons, which is why general manager, Ozzie Newsome elected to draft Lamar Jackson in the first round of the 2018 draft.
    <LI>This is Newsome's last year as the general manager and many believe this to be a "legacy pick".</UL> </p>
